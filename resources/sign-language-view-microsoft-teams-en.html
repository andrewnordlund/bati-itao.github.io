		<p>An exciting feature in Microsoft Teams is the Sign Language view. The Sign Language View is an option designed to help signers, sign language interpreters, and any one else who use sign language in a Teams meeting. 
			Sign Language View creates a more predictable meeting experience for users in a virtual meeting.</p>
	<p>With Sign Language View, users are able to identify up to two signers and have these videos remain displayed in a static position on center stage. The identified videos will appear at the right aspect ratio and will use the highest available video quality.</p>
		<p>While using Sign Language View:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As long as the identified signers videos are turned on, their videos will stay visible on the center stage.</li>
	<li>As long as the identified signers videos are turned on, their videos will stay visible on the center stage.</li>
	<li>Sign Language View is a personal setting in Teams meaning other participants will not be alerted when someone is using Sign Language View and other participants view of the meeting will not be changed.</li>
	<li>Both people inside and outside of the organization can be added to Sign Language View.</li>
	<li>When content is shared during a meeting the signers video stays larger, more visible and remains at a higher quality but the video will shift to a different part of the stage.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The Sign Language View does not provide sign language interpreters. Sign Language Interpretation will need to be arranged before the virtual meeting.</p>
<p>For more information on arranging Sign Language Interpretation, please visit the 
	<a href="https://bati-itao.github.io/resources/CART-services-Sign-Language-Interpreters-en.html">IT Accessibility Office - CART Services and Sign Language Interpreters (SLI) page.</a></p>

<p>Sign Language View must be enabled by the user in the settings before it can be used.</p>
<p>To enable Sign Language View by default across all your Teams meetings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open Microsoft Teams.</li>
	<li>Select the Settings and more option (displayed as ···).</li>
	<li>Then select Settings.</li>
	<li>Then select Accessibility.</li>
	<li>Then turn on Sign language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can assign sign language interpreters before a meeting only if the sign language interpreter is in the organization.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Select the Settings and more option (displayed as ···).</li>
	<li>Then select Settings.</li>
	<li>Then select Accessibility.</li>
	<li>Then turn on Sign language.</li>
	<li>Select Manage preferred signers.</li>
	<li>Type the name of the interpreter and choose the person from the results list.</li>
	<li>Close the Add people as signers window once complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can assign sign language interpreters during a meeting by using the Accessibility tab. To do this you must have previously turned on the Sign Language option in the Accessibility tab in the settings.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Select the Settings and more option (displayed as ···).</li>
<li>Then select Accessibility.</li>
<li>Then select Manage preferred signers.</li>
<li>Type the name of the interpreter and choose the person from the results list.</li>
<li>Select Save when complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can also choose a sign language interpreter from the Participants list or participant context menu. This option is useful when interpreters are from outside the organization. To do this you must have previously turned on the Sign Language option in the Accessibility tab in the settings.</p>

<p>To add a signer from the participant list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Select People.</li>
	<li>Find the person to be made a signer and then select More options (displayed as ···).</li>
	<li>Select Make a signer.</li>
	
</ul>


<p>To add a signer from the participant context menu:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select More options (displayed as ···) next to the person’s name in their video.</li>
	<li>Select Make a signer.</li>
	</ul>
