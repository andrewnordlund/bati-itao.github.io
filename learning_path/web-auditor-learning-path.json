No course can be exhaustive. Most knowledge will be gained through experience. This learning path will lay the foundation allowing you to build upon it as you practice web development and accessibility auditing.</p><p>Most training courses in this learning path will either be free, or readily paid for. (Courses are free unless a cost is listed.) Most are self-paced and start as soon as you want so you can start learning without delay.</p><p>Note: the courses provided by the Government of Canada are available in both Official Languages. The rest, however, are mostly English only.</p><p>Target Audience:</p><ul><li>Web Accessibility Auditors</li><li>Those interested in web development with an eye towards accessibility</li></ul>",

					"en" : "<h3>What does this have to do with accessibility?</h3><p>It's said that the best way to identify a counterfeit dollar bill is to know what a real dollar bill looks like.  Likewise, the best way to spot bad HTML is to know proper HTML.  HTML was designed from the beginning to be accessible to users of assistive technologies.</p><p>HTML is a semantic language, meaning that its elements have meaning.  Certain HTML elements expose themselves to assistive technologies in special ways.  For example, an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> may look big and bold, but it means that it's a top-level heading. The difference between regular text styled to look big and bold is completely different to a screen reader user.  It is important to understand the meaning behind the different HTML elements and attributes.</p><h3>What does Git Have To With Accessibility</h3><p>Nowadays, in a technical field such as web development, knowing Git is a bit like knowing about MS Excel Pivot Tables in data analysis.  You can probably get by for a while without knowing it.  But sooner or later you're going to need to learn it.  You don't need to become an expert.  But when time comes to use it, you don't want to be starting from scratch.</p><p>You'll start by building a small website.  GitHub allows websites to be hosted on their GH Pages.  So before doing that, we'll start with learning basic Git.</p>",

				"en" : "<p>Now that you have a foundation of web development, it's time to build on that.  We now turn our attention to accessibility and WCAG.</p><p>The term \"Accessible\" could be defined as \"usable by all\".  Whether or not something, say a website, is accessible is somewhat subjective. Having a standard makes it objective.  WCAG 2.1 (Level AA) is the standard we use.  As an example, how much contrast between adjacent colours is needed varies by user.  WCAG gives a definitive answer:  for text against background, it's 4.5 to 1.</p><p>It's important to understand basic accessibility principles like different disability groups and how they each interact with the Web.  And it's important to know WCAG so you can interpret, apply, and reference it during an accessibility audit.</p><p>As for which specific courses to take, there is some choice.  Ideally, you should take the T716 course offered by Canada School of the Public Service.  But spots may not be readily available.  Alternatively, the Accessibility for Web Development course offered by ESDC College is offered more frequently.  But it's not as in-depth, and it can still be a few weeks before you can get a spot.  And you want to start learning now.</p><p>Below are some options to get you started today.</p>",
