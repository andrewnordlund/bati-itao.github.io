					<h1>Web Auditor Learning Path (Draft)</h1>
	
					<!-- Learning Path 1 -->
					<h2>Accessibility Auditor</h2>
					<p>After completing the learning path, you will have a basic understanding of the technologies that the Web is built on, a basic understanding of accessibility as it pertains to the Web, mobile, documents, and eventually desktop; and how to build and evaluate rich internet applications. No course can be exhaustive.  Most knowledge will be gained through experience.  This learning path will lay the foundation allowing you to build upon it as you practice web development and accessibility auditing.</p>
					<p>Most training courses in this learning path will either be free, or readily paid for.  (Courses are free unless a cost is listed.) Most are self-paced and start as soon as you want so you can start learning without delay.</p>
					<p>Note: the courses provided by the Government of Canada are available in both Official Languages.  The rest, however, are mostly English only.</p>
					
					<p>Target Audience:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Web Accessibility Auditors</li>
						<li>Those interested in web development with an eye towards accessibility</li>
					</ul>

								<p><strong>Objective:</strong> You will learn the fundamental building blocks of a website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and build a simple website hosted on GitHub pages.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>What does this have to do with accessibility?</h3>
							<p>It's said that the best way to identify a counterfeit dollar bill is to know what a real dollar bill looks like.  Likewise, the best way to spot bad HTML is to know proper HTML.  HTML was designed from the beginning to be accessible to users of assistive technologies.</p>
							<p>HTML is a semantic language, meaning that its elements have meaning.  Certain HTML elements expose themselves to assistive technologies in special ways.  For example, an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> may look big and bold, but it means that it's a top-level heading. The difference between regular text styled to look big and bold is completely different to a screen reader user.  It is important to understand the meaning behind the different HTML elements and attributes.</p>
							<h3>What does Git Have To With Accessibility</h3>
							<p>Nowadays, in a technical field such as web development, knowing Git is a bit like knowing about MS Excel Pivot Tables in data analysis.  You can probably get by for a while without knowing it.  But sooner or later you're going to need to learn it.  You don't need to become an expert.  But when time comes to use it, you don't want to be starting from scratch.</p>
							<p>You'll start by building a small website.  GitHub allows websites to be hosted on their GH Pages.  So before doing that, we'll start with learning basic Git.</p>

								<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To learn the fundamental principles of accessibility, WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 at the AA level, and performing accessibility audits.</p>
							</div>
							<p>Now that you have a foundation of web development, it's time to build on that.  We now turn our attention to accessibility and WCAG.</p>
							<p>The term "Accessible" could be defined as "usable by all".  Whether or not something, say a website, is accessible is somewhat subjective. Having a standard makes it objective.  WCAG 2.1 (Level AA) is the standard we use.  As an example, how much contrast between adjacent colours is needed varies by user.  WCAG gives a definitive answer:  for text against background, it's 4.5 to 1.</p>
							<p>It's important to understand basic accessibility principles like different disability groups and how they each interact with the Web.  And it's important to know WCAG so you can interpret, apply, and reference it during an accessibility audit.</p>
							<p>As for which specific courses to take, there is some choice.  Ideally, you should take the T716 course offered by Canada School of the Public Service.  But spots may not be readily available.  Alternatively, the Accessibility for Web Development course offered by ESDC College is offered more frequently.  But it's not as in-depth, and it can still be a few weeks before you can get a spot.  And you want to start learning now.</p>

								<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To take your ability to audit to the next level.  This includes understanding WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications), and ATAG (Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines).</p>
							</div>
							<h3>WAI-ARIA</h3>
							<p>Now that you have a foundation of web development and accessibility, it's time to build on that.  We now turn our attention to WAI-ARIA, or "ARIA" for short.</p>
							<p>ARIA is used to enhance accessibility in web applications.  You will need to be able to identify improper ARIA in web audits, and offer advice on how to fix errors.</p>
							<p>Learning WAI-ARIA is a years-long pursuit, learning what roles require which parent and child roles, which stand on their own, what browser and screen reader combos support what aria, etc.  But you will run into WAI-ARIA sooner rather than later.</p>
							<p>Below are some options to get you started today.</p>

												<dt>Purpose</dt>
												<dd>To get some real experience adding ARIA to HTML.</dd>
												<dt>Goal:</dt>
												<dd>Add ARIA to the small website you created in Blocks A and B.</dd>
												<dt>Complete the following:</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>In part 3 of Block B you added JavaScript that would add some text to the page when the user clicked a button.  Now add appropriate ARIA to make the page accessible:</p>
													<ul>
														<li>For the text that's added when the user clicks the button, ensure a screen reader would be notified of that text without moving the user's focus.</li>
														<li>If any of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s on the page have extra instructions or help text, or anything a screen reader will miss in Forms Mode, ensure that information will be exposed to screen readers using the proper ARIA.  If none of the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s have any help text or inline instruction, add some and ensure it's properly exposed to screen readers.</li>
														<li>Update any parts of the site that could be implemented with greater accessibility.</li>
													</ul>
													<p>Send the link to the Team Lead or Technical Advisor overseeing your training.</p>

							<h3>ATAG</h3>
							<p>ATAG is applied to anything that can generate content.  This could be a full-blown CMS (Content Management System), or a comments section on a website, or graphics creation software.</p>
